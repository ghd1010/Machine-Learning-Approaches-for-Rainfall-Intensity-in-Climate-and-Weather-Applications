# Rainfall Intensity 🌧️

Weather forecasting is a fundamental aspect of understanding and preparing for atmospheric conditions that significantly impact our daily lives. The process of accurately predicting weather conditions is complex as weather patterns observed in recent years are changing rapidly. However, by leveraging the power of machine learning, we can unlock new insights and capabilities in weather forecasting that have the potential to transform how we understand, prepare for, and respond to weather conditions. In this project, existing applications of machine learning techniques in weather prediction are reviewed. Additionally, the implementation of three different machine learning and deep learning classifiers which are Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest. The performance of the three models was evaluated based on accuracy matric. The experimental results showed that the accuracy values for the Decision Tree, ANN, and Random Forest models for the testing phase are 90%, 92%, 93% respectively. This shows that the Random Forest model has better performance than the other models.
